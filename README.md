## Data Source  
1. COVID-19 Trend Data: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home
2. Vaccination Data: https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series
3. State Characteristic Data: https://datacommons.org/; https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/119446/version/V129/view?path=/openicpsr/119446/fcr:versions/V129/COVID-19-US-State-Policy-Database-master/COVID-19-US-state-policy-database-9_20_2021.xlsx&type=file  

## Objective
1. Train Random Forest and XGBoost models to forecast COVID-19 trend in following 7 days.
2. Test and Evaluate the model, choose the best one to predict the following 7 days.  
3. Deploy the model into a dashboard.

## Data Science Plan
**1. Data Plan**  
The COVID-19 trend data from CDC is utilized to train, test and validate the model. The initial data we had was COVID-19 daily cases and deaths by state from 2021/2/10 to 2021/11/14. Also, we
